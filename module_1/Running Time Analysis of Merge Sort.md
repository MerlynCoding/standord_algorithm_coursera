# Running Time Analysis of Merge Sort

## Introduction
Merge Sort is a recursive **divide-and-conquer** algorithm with superior performance compared to simpler sorting methods like Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort. This analysis substantiates its performance claim: **Merge Sort runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time**, specifically requiring no more than \(6n \log n + 6n\) operations.

---

## Key Idea: Recursion Tree Method
To analyze Merge Sort, we use the **recursion tree method**, which represents the algorithm’s work in a tree structure. Each node in the tree corresponds to a recursive call, with:
- **Root**: Represents the initial call on the entire input array.
- **Children**: Correspond to the two recursive calls made by the parent.

This structure allows us to systematically count the operations performed at each level of recursion and across the entire tree.

## Structure of the Recursion Tree

### Levels in the Tree:
1. **Level 0**: The root represents the input array of size \(n\).
2. **Level 1**: Two recursive calls, each operating on arrays of size \(n/2\).
3. **Level 2**: Four recursive calls, each operating on arrays of size \(n/4\).
4. **Base Case**: Recursion bottoms out when the arrays have size 1 (single-element arrays).

### Total Levels:
- The recursion divides the input size by 2 at each level.
- The number of levels is \(\log_2 n + 1\) (including the base case).

---

## Counting Operations: Level-by-Level Analysis

### At Level \(j\):
1. **Number of Subproblems**: \(2^j\).
2. **Input Size per Subproblem**: \(n / 2^j\).
3. **Work per Subproblem**:
   - Each subproblem calls the **merge** routine.
   - Merging an array of size \(n / 2^j\) requires at most \(6(n / 2^j)\) operations (from earlier merge analysis).

### Total Work at Level \(j\):
\[
\text{Total Work} = 2^j \times 6 \left(\frac{n}{2^j}\right) = 6n
\]
This remarkable result shows that the work at each level is constant (\(6n\)), independent of \(j\).

---

## Total Work Across All Levels
To compute the total work:
1. There are \(\log_2 n + 1\) levels in the recursion tree.
2. Each level contributes at most \(6n\) operations.

### Total Work:
\[
\text{Total Work} = (\log_2 n + 1) \times 6n = 6n \log_2 n + 6n
\]

## Insights and Interpretation

### Why \(6n \log n + 6n\)?
1. **Divide-and-Conquer Trade-Off**:
   - The number of subproblems doubles at each level.
   - The input size per subproblem halves at each level.
   - These two effects cancel each other, leading to constant work (\(6n\)) at each level.

2. **Logarithmic Depth**:
   - The recursion depth grows logarithmically with input size (\(\log_2 n\)).
   - This logarithmic growth ensures that Merge Sort scales efficiently for large \(n\).

---

## Comparison with Simpler Sorting Algorithms
### Simpler Algorithms:
- **Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort**:
  - Require \(O(n^2)\) operations in the worst case.
  - Example: Sorting \(n = 1000\) elements requires \(1,000,000\) operations.

### Merge Sort:
- Requires \(O(n \log n)\) operations.
- Example: Sorting \(n = 1000\) elements requires approximately \(10,000\) operations.

---

## Why \(O(n \log n)\) Matters
### Growth of \(\log n\):
- The logarithm grows much slower than linear or quadratic functions.
- For large inputs (\(n\)), \(\log n\) ensures that Merge Sort remains practical and scalable.

---

## Conclusion
Merge Sort’s **\(O(n \log n)\)** performance demonstrates the power of divide-and-conquer:
1. The recursion tree method highlights the balance between the proliferation of subproblems and the shrinking input size.
2. This balance ensures constant work per level and efficient sorting for large datasets.

Merge Sort is a testament to algorithmic ingenuity, showcasing why divide-and-conquer is a cornerstone of algorithm design.
