# Algorithms Specialization: Week 1 Overview

## Welcome
Welcome to the Algorithms Specialization! This document provides an overview of the first week’s material. Let’s get started!

## Course Overview
Algorithms are at the heart of computer science. This specialization introduces algorithms to learners with basic programming experience. It emphasizes understanding key concepts and their practical applications rather than focusing on low-level implementation details. By the end, you will have a strong grasp of algorithms, comparable to those with advanced studies in the subject.

### Topics Covered in Part 1:
- **Big-O Notation**: A framework for analyzing algorithm efficiency.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Core techniques for data manipulation.
- **Divide and Conquer**:
  - Master method for analysis.
  - Applications like integer and matrix multiplication.
  - Solving the closest pair problem.
- **Randomized Algorithms**:
  - QuickSort.
  - Contraction algorithm for minimum cuts.

## Week 1 Highlights
### Introduction
Here’s what you’ll learn in the first set of lectures:
- **Why Algorithms Matter**: Learn how algorithms solve problems efficiently and why they are crucial in computer science.
- **Integer Multiplication**: See how clever algorithms can outperform basic methods when multiplying two integers.
- **Merge Sort**:
  - A must-know, famous sorting algorithm.
  - Teaches the **"divide and conquer"** method, breaking problems into smaller parts.
  - Prepares you for more complex algorithms later in the course.
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Learn how to evaluate and compare algorithms to determine their efficiency.

### Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O Notation)
This section introduces **Big-O notation**, a tool for analyzing algorithm performance:
- Focus on how running time scales as input size grows (ignore small details like constants).
- Learn to describe algorithm efficiency simply and effectively.
- Understand the balance between detail and clarity when reasoning about algorithms.

## Learning Resources
### Recommended Textbook
- **Algorithms Illuminated (Part 1)** by Tim Roughgarden: [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999282905)

### Additional Resources
- **Mathematics for Computer Science** by Eric Lehman and Tom Leighton: [Link](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos341/handouts/mathcs.pdf)

### Videos and Slides
- **Videos**: Stream or download them for flexibility (great for commutes).
- **Slides**: PDF versions of lecture content are available for easy reference.
- **Subtitles**: Provided in English and sometimes other languages.
- **Adjust Video Speed**: Watch at your own pace (faster or slower).

## Weekly Assignments
### Homework for Week 1
- **Problem Set**: Five multiple-choice questions covering:
  - The Merge Sort algorithm.
  - Asymptotic analysis (Big-O notation).
- **Programming Assignment**: Implement one or more integer multiplication algorithms from the lectures.

### Policies for Assignments
- **Problem Sets**: Two attempts allowed in a 12-hour period (best score counts).
- **Programming Assignments**: Ten attempts allowed in a 12-hour period (best score counts).
- **Final Exam**: One attempt allowed per 24 hours.
- Grading requirements:
  - Problem sets: At least 4 out of 5 correct (80%).
  - Programming assignments: 100% correct answers.
  - Final exam: At least 70% correct (7 out of 10).
  - To pass the course, you must complete all assignments and the final exam.

### Optional Theory Problems
- **Purpose**: Develop a deeper understanding of algorithm design and analysis.
- **Credit**: No deadlines or credit given.
- **Discussion**: Participate in forums to share and explore solutions.

## How to Use the Discussion Forums
Make the most of the forums to enhance your learning:
- **Ask for Help**: If something isn’t clear or you’re stuck on an assignment, post your questions.
- **Help Others**: Share your knowledge once you’ve mastered the material.
- The instructor will occasionally drop in to answer questions, so check back often.
