# Algorithms Specialization: Week 1 Overview

## Welcome
Welcome to the Algorithms Specialization! This document provides an overview of the first week’s material. Let’s get started!

## Week 1 Highlights
### Introduction
Here’s what you’ll learn in the first set of lectures:
- **Why Algorithms Matter**: Learn how algorithms solve problems efficiently and why they are crucial in computer science.
- **Integer Multiplication**: See how clever algorithms can outperform basic methods when multiplying two integers.
- **Merge Sort**:
  - A must-know, famous sorting algorithm.
  - Teaches the **"divide and conquer"** method, breaking problems into smaller parts.
  - Prepares you for more complex algorithms later in the course.
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Learn how to evaluate and compare algorithms to determine their efficiency.

### Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O Notation)
This section introduces **Big-O notation**, a tool for analyzing algorithm performance:
- Focus on how running time scales as input size grows (ignore small details like constants).
- Learn to describe algorithm efficiency simply and effectively.
- Understand the balance between detail and clarity when reasoning about algorithms.

## What You Need to Know (Prerequisites)
This course assumes you already have:
- **Programming Skills**: Be comfortable coding in Python, Java, or C.
- **Basic Math Knowledge**: You’ll need to understand concepts like proofs (e.g., induction, contradiction) and mathematical reasoning.

If you need a refresher, check out the **"Mathematics for Computer Science"** notes by Lehman and Leighton (find these in the Resources section).

## How to Use the Discussion Forums
Make the most of the forums to enhance your learning:
- **Ask for Help**: If something isn’t clear or you’re stuck on an assignment, post your questions.
- **Help Others**: Share your knowledge once you’ve mastered the material.
- The instructor will occasionally drop in to answer questions, so check back often.

## Learning Resources
- **Videos**: Stream or download them for flexibility (great for commutes).
- **Slides**: PDF versions of lecture content are available for easy reference.
- **Subtitles**: Provided in English and sometimes other languages.
- **Adjust Video Speed**: Watch at your own pace (faster or slower).

## Homework for Week 1
- **Problem Set**: Five multiple-choice questions covering:
  - The Merge Sort algorithm.
  - Asymptotic analysis (Big-O notation).
- **Programming Assignment**: Implement one or more integer multiplication algorithms from the lectures.
